In "To = ['email_receiver@mail.com']", switch the "email_receiver@mail.com" to the email you wish to send the email.

In "days = input('Which days would you like to send the email?' )", insert the days you wish to send the email, withou spaces, and with commas.

In email_content = """
                <html>
                    <head>Title 1</head>
                    <p>Content 1</p>
                </html>
                ""
Insert the html content to your email.

In "msg['Subject'] = 'Enter Subject'", switch "Enter Subject" to the Subject you wish your email to have.

In "password = "Your_Password"", switch "Your_Password" to the password of the email with which you wish to send the email.

In "msg['From'] = "your_email@mail.com"", switch "your_email@mail.com" to the email with which you wish to send the email.
